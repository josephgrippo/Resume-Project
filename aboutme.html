    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I have my certificate in responsive web design from "freecodecamp". I also have taken the full stack web developer course from Udemy under Dr. Angela Yu. I currently study software development as a student at Bellevue University. My hobbies include playing drums and playing softball. I sometimes like to enjoy some video games as well. My favorite video game right now is Fortnite.</p>
